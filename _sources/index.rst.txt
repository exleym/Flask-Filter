Flask-Filter: A simple search extension
=======================================
Flask-Filter provides a simple extension to the Flask web framework that
provides detailed search functionality for REST APIs.

The search functionality turns a JSON list of `Filter` objects of the form

`{"field": "name", "op": "=", "value": "Fido"}`

into chained filters on a SQLAlchemy query. By leveraging the great work done
by the SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow teams, we are able to easily provide a
standardized search function to REST APIs.

Welcome to the new age!
