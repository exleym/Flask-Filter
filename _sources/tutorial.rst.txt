Tutorial
========
This will eventually be a tutorial for using Flask-Filter. Woot!

Example 1: The FlaskFilter Extension
------------------------------------
The simplest and most effective way to use this library is through the
``FlaskFilter`` extension. Instantiate this object as a singleton and
register it with the ``Flask`` application object, and you can query
resources with the ``search`` method from any view.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask

    # Pet Model defined as subclass of `db.Model`
    from pet_store import Pet, PetSchema

    # SQLAlchemy and FlaskFilter objects created as singletons
    from pet_store.extensions import db, filtr

    app = Flask(__name__)
    db.init_app(app)
    filtr.init_app(app)


    @app.route('/api/v1/pets/search', methods=['POST']
    def pet_search():
        pets = filtr.search(Pet, request.json.get("filters"), PetSchema)
        return jsonify(pet_schema.dump(pets)), 200



Example 2: Preregistering your Models
-------------------------------------
You can also pre-register your models and schemas with the ``FlaskFilter``
object, after which you will not need to pass the schema directly to the
``search()`` method. This feature could be helpful if you are attempting to
auto-generate CRUD endpoints.

.. code-block:: python

    # Register in the app factory
    filtr.register_model(Dog, DogSchema)

    # in some endpoint down the line, you can now search like this:
    filters = filter_schema.load(request.json.get("filters"))
    pets = filtr.search(Pet, filters)


Example 3: Automatic Code Generation
------------------------------------
If you are using Flask-Restplus to build resource-driven APIs, ``Flask-Filter``
allows you to automatically generate search endpoints and register them
with your Swagger documentation:

.. note::

    Note: this example is built with Flask-RestX and Flask-Accepts
    to pair Marshmallow directly with Flask-Restplus and avoid the
    duplication of serializers common with Flask-Restplus.

Use a simple search-endpoint factory function like this one to easily
create search endpoints for all of your resources. Pair this with some
other factory functions for a full auto-CRUD tool.

.. code-block:: python

    def generate_search(api, namespace, Schema, Model, filtr,
                        name: str = None) -> type(Resource):
        """ factory function for creating a Resource search Manager in
        Flask-Restplus API application. Pass me an `api` object and a
        Restplus resource namespace along with a Marshmallow Schema and
        a SQLAlchemy model, and I will generate / register your search
        endpoint.
        """
        res_name = name or Schema.__name__.replace("Schema", "")
        schema = Schema()

        @namespace.route("/search")
        class ResourceSearch(Resource):

            @namespace.doc(f"execute a resource search for {res_name}")
            @accepts(schema=SearchSchema, api=api)
            @responds(
                schema=Schema(many=True),
                status_code=200,
                api=api
            )
            def post(self):
                filters = namespace.payload.get("filters")
                return filtr.search(
                    DbModel=Model,
                    filters=filters,
                    ModelSchema=schema
                )

        return ResourceSearch

    # Now generate some search endpoints with this factory function
    generate_search(api, ns_dogs, DogSchema, Dog, filtr)
    generate_search(api, ns_toys, ToySchema, Toy, filtr)
    generate_search(api, ns_usr, UserSchema, User, filtr)

.. image:: _static/routes.png

The generate_search function shown above will register endpoints and
document them in the swagger spec. If you click on the "search" endpoint
in that image, you get the detailed documentation of your post request
body.

Example 4: Extending FlaskFilter -- Adding a new Filter
-------------------------------------------------------
There may come a situation where the default filters provided by
this library do not meet the needs of your application. In this
event, you can extend the filter set provided by the ``FlaskFilter``
library and create your own filters that can be added to a search
endpoint.

The default filters provided in version 0.1 of this library are
as follows:

- LTFilter
- LTEFilter
- EqualsFilter
- GTFilter
- GTEFilter
- InFilter
- NotEqualsFilter
- LikeFilter
- ContainsFilter

These should cover most situations, but let's imaging a business
need for a search endpoint that allows users to query with a
``NotInFilter`` to complement the ``InFilter``.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask_filter.filters.filters import Filter
    from flask_filter.filters import FILTERS

    class NotInFilter(Filter):
        """ Custom not-in filter extending FlaskFilter search """
        OP = "!in"

        def __init__(self, field: str, value: Any):
            if isinstance(value, str):
                value = [value]
            super().__init__(field, value)

        def apply(self, query, class_, schema=None):
            field = self._get_db_field(schema)
            return query.filter(
                getattr(class_, field).notin_(list(self.value))
            )

        def is_valid(self):
            try:
                _ = (e for e in self.value)
            except TypeError:
                raise ValidationError(f"{self} must be an iterable")

    FILTERS.append(NotInFilter)

This implementation works fine, but let's look at the similarities
between what we just wrote and the existing InFilter -- maybe we
would be better off extending the InFilter to create a more easily
maintained class:

.. code-block:: python

    class InFilter(Filter):
        OP = "in"

        def __init__(self, field: str, value: Any):
            if isinstance(value, str):
                value = [value]
            super().__init__(field, value)

        def apply(self, query, class_, schema=None):
            field = self._get_db_field(schema)
            return query.filter(
                getattr(class_, field).in_(list(self.value))
            )

        def is_valid(self):
            try:
                _ = (e for e in self.value)
            except TypeError:
                raise ValidationError(f"{self} must be an iterable")

Whoops! There's only a few tiny changes that had to be made to the
existing InFilter. Looking closely the only things that differ are:

- the class name itself
- the ``OP`` class variable
- the filter used in the apply method

This extension could be accomplished much more effectively by
sub-classing the ``InFilter`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    class NotInFilter(InFilter):
        OP = "!in"

        def apply(self, query, class_, schema=None):
            field = self._get_db_field(schema)
            return query.filter(
                getattr(class_, field).notin_(list(self.value))
            )

    FILTERS.append(NotInFilter)
